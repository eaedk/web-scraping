# Overview

Here is a repository to share my web scraping activities. I like to spend some hours having fun doing scraping. You may propose other websites you want me to scrape.

# Web scraping

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

# Technologies
I will use many technologies to do the web scraping of websites :

- [Selenium](https://github.com/eaedk/web-scraping/tree/master/selenium)
